# IntegratingClonedGithubRepoWithGoogleColabAndGithubControl
Code to help integrate a cloned github repo into the google colab environment, while allowing git commands such as git push and git commit from the colab environment itself. A use case of this could be cloning a deep learning github repo, and then running the code in google colab in order to use a GPU to speed up the processs.

For instructions, please look at CloneRepoIntoGoogleDrive_General.ipynb and open it in google colab in order to run it.

You can use the following github repo as an example repo that was setup to work with google colab: https://github.com/sanmesh1/TextSimilarityUsingWord2Vec
